# StoneWall

Inspired from a quote "The arrow that comes out of the bow and the words that come out of the mouth never comes back." <br>
I created this micro blogging platform that do not allow user to delete or edit the posts or comments once sent. <br>
Nowadays there is no weight or a sense of responsibilty in people posting anything on internet.
<br>
this web app has following features: <br>
- User registration <br>
- Follow ,Like system <br>
- Comments <br>
- Posts, Profile views <br>
- responsiveness ( logo is used as a button to implement the hamburger functionality for handheld devices)
